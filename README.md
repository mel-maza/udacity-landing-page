# Landing Page Project
This is the landing page project of the udacity frontend developer course.
The project shows a landing page with dynamical navigation.
The navigation bar is automatically expanded when new sections are added to the index.html file. You can navigate to a specific section by clicking on the appropriate navbar list element. When scrolling to a specific section, the navbar highlights the visible section.

## Project Setup
* Open the `index.html` - file in a browser (chrome is recommended)

## What You're Getting
```bash
├── README.md - This file.

└── js # contains everything needed for dynamic changes
    └── app.js # contains dynamic changes due to browser events
